![Me](assets/images/lahiru.jpg)

Welcome to my personal blog! My name is Lahiru Udayanga, and I'm thrilled to have you here.

I'm a 25-year-old Software Engineer currently living in Colombo, Sri Lanka. I hold a B.Sc (hons) in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Moratuwa, and I'm currently employed at WSO2 Inc. as a software engineer working on Kubernetes native API gateways.

I started this blog as a way to share my thoughts and experiences with the world. Whether it's my latest travel adventure, a new technology or a programming language I've tried, or my take on current events, I love to share my perspective and connect with others who share similar interests.

I believe that life is meant to be lived to the fullest, and I hope that my blog inspires you to try new things, embrace your passions, and live your best life.

Thank you for visiting, and I can't wait to share more with you in the future!
