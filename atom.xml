        <title>From Sunset to Sunrise....</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/2gpcmkuo7f1uL7V89&quot;&gt;Blue beach island&lt;/a&gt; is a small island located in the Nilwella area in between Dickwella and Tangalle. The island is known for its stunning sunsets and tranquil environment, making it an ideal spot to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The island is connected to the mainland by a small narrow sand dune which can be submerged by sea water during high tides or during the southwest monsoons. For this reason, it is advisable to plan your visit in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deep dive into Kubernetes custom controllers</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes offers a rich ecosystem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/&quot;&gt;extension points&lt;/a&gt; that allow developers to tailor and extend its functionality. Among these ability to implement Custom Controllers emerge as a powerful mechanism for extending Kubernetes with your own ‚ÄúKubernetes logic‚Äù. While there are frameworks and tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder&quot;&gt;Kubebuilder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sdk.operatorframework.io/&quot;&gt;OperatorSDK&lt;/a&gt; that abstracts away the complexity of implementing custom controllers, understanding how custom controllers operate at a fundamental level is crucial for those who wish to harness the full potential of Kubernetes. In this article, we will go through how custom controllers work behind the scenes and how you can leverage the basic building blocks of custom controllers for your use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to implement a K8s operator like a Ninja</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes has emerged as the widely accepted standard for deploying and running modern cloud-native applications. With its declarative approach using YAML, it offers a straightforward and intuitive method to define the desired infrastructure state for application deployments. However, managing complex application deployments on Kubernetes requires additional automation and control beyond what Kubernetes provides out of the box. This is where Kubernetes operators come in.&lt;/p&gt;
