It's amazing how a single photo can transport you back to a place you visited years ago. Today, I find myself reminiscing about my time in Siwa, Egypt which I visited back in July 2018.

Siwa is an ancient city located in Egypt's western desert near the border with Libya, known for its natural beauty and unique Berber culture. The city is situated on an oasis, surrounded by palm groves, freshwater springs, and a salt lake that glimmers in the desert sun. Siwa is also home to several ancient temples, including the Temple of the Oracle of Amun, which dates back to the 6th century BCE and was a site of pilgrimage for ancient Egyptians seeking divine guidance.

I was fortunate enough to explore Siwa, Egypt as part of a 6-week volunteering program organized by AIESEC. This opportunity not only allowed me to give back to the community but also gave me the chance to immerse myself in the unique culture and natural beauty of this hidden gem in the heart of the Sahara desert.

We started the journey from Cairo on July 28, 2018, and first we went to Alexandria. From Alexandria, we went to Marsa Matruh and took the Marsa Matruh - Siwa road, which took around 12 hours to reach Siwa. We checked in to a nice, cozy garden hotel in the center of Siwa, which I don't remember the name exactly. After relaxing for a few hours, we explored Siwa City, which is basically a classical Middle Eastern bazaar with some hotels and restaurants that are targeted at tourists.
